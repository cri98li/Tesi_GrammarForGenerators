The tags object contains a set of tags for this resource as pairs of attributes and values. For example, a researcher might tag a suffix with the attribute `person`, and a value of `3`, to indicate that the particular suffix is 3rd Person. If no value is needed, the value may also be set to `true` or `false` (but not `null`), however users are encouraged to use both attribute and value for every tag, since this helps identify the larger category that the tag value belongs to. Note: The Tags object does not have a `type` property.","additionalProperties":{"oneOf":[{"type":"string"},{"type":"boolean"},{"type":"number"}],"description":"A single tag, as an attribute-value pair.","title":"Tag"},"title":"Tags","type":"object","$id":"http:\/\/schemas.digitallinguistics.io\/Tags-2.1.0.json"}
