This method works well as long as the corner of the image has not been padded with zeros. Currently GE zeros out the pixel intensity outside of the brain. So for new GE data we calculate the noise by taking the standard deviation of the b=0 images (noiseCalcMethod = 'b0') which means that we need a number of b0 acquisitions. If you are using robust tensor fitting you must decide how to calculate the image noise. If the corner of the image is padded with zeros then you should use the 'b0' method which calculates the noise based on the std of the b0 image.
