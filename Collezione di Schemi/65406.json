{"$schema":"http:\/\/json-schema.org\/draft-04\/schema#","description":"A Control Statement is a statement by a company or entity about a the control of a company. In its most straightforward, Company A may say that Entity B controls it. Each statement should be about a single control relationship, i.e. if Company A has two controlling entities, B and C, and those   control relationships are distinct (e.g. they started at a different time) then they should each be stored as a indiviudal Control Statements. They should only be stored in the same Control Statement if it is logically part of the same control mechanism, e.g. if company A is controlled by person C and person D, who control the shares *jointly*. Control Statements can be used to describe that an entity has no controlling entity, or that the controlling entity is not disclosed. Beneficial Ownership is a specific example of control relationships, and the ultimate_beneficial_owner flag can be used to signify that a person is the Ultimate Beneficial Owner of a
