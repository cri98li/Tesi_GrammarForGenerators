{"$schema":"http:\/\/json-schema.org\/draft-04\/hyper-schema","description":"Update custom field answers for a set of applicants in a single API request using a batch action.\nA batch action is an asynchronous operation that can be created using a first endpoint and then have its result checked\nusing another endpoint.\nFirst the batch action is created using the __POST__ (create) endpoint by sending in the request body, the JSON describing all the\nchanges to apply. The creation endpoint validates the changes and then schedules the batch to be executed returning a batch\n**id** to check the result later on.\nThen the __GET__ (show) endpoint can be used to check the completion of the scheduled batch, using the **id** returned by the\nprevious __POST__. Once the batch has finished, the result will be included in the batch object.","links":[{"schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"___id":{"$fref":"\/schemata\/batch_custom_field_answers\/definitions\/id"}},"required":["id"]},"method":"GET","rel":"self","description":"Retrieve the status of a running\/done batch action initiated with a previous POST.
