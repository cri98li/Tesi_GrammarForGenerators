In DLx, a lexeme refers broadly to any bundle of related senses and forms, whether the item is an individual word, morpheme, idiom, etc. \u2014 anything that constitues a semantic unit. Examples of lexemes in English might include *be*, *run up*, and *\u2011ing*. A lexeme will typically have multiple *senses* or meanings, and those are listed in the `senses` property. It is up to the linguist to decide when two meanings are related, and therefore belong to the same lexeme, or when they belong to different lexemes. A lexeme often also has multiple base forms, such as suppletive forms, irregular forms, or morphologically-conditioned forms. For example, the lexeme *be* has the base forms *be*, *am*, *is*, etc. These are listed in the `forms` field. The `forms` field should **not** be used to list all the regularly-inflected forms of a word. Individual base forms may have phonologically-conditioned allomorphs, and these are listed in the `allomorphs` field of the form. The lexeme and its forms and senses may also have variations, such as dialectal and idiolectal variants, rapid speech variants, register-based variants, variations in meaning, or even spelling variants. These are listed in the `variants` fields. By convention, one of the forms of a lexeme is typically chosen as a representative headword or *lemma*, and this is indicated by the `lemma` field. For example, the form *man* is typically used as the lemma\/headword for the lexeme that includes the forms *man* and *men*. Note that the DLx Lexeme does **not** represent a lexical entry in a dictionary. Dictionaries typically list each base form of a lexeme as a separate lexical entry. The DLx Lexeme lists puts each of these lexical entries together in the `forms` field instead.","additionalProperties":true,"$comment":"This is a top-level database object.","title":"Lexeme","type":"object","properties":{"___language":{"$eref":{"examples":[{"referenceType":"Utterance","index":2,"id":"73384c91-6c15-42a4-81e3-9c7d03343bad","type":"DatabaseReference","url":"https:\/\/api.digitallinguistics.io\/languages\/Chitimacha\/texts\/A1\/utterances\/2"},{"name":"Ómoíséké ósokérété chíséese","referenceType":"Text","id":"6c4268c0-5249-408d-92ba-9daff1cab616","type":"DatabaseReference","url":"https:\/\/api.digitallinguistics.io\/languages\/Gusii\/texts\/Omoiseke","key":"Omoiseke"}],"$schema":"http:\/\/json-schema.org\/draft-07\/schema#","description":"A reference to an item in a database, used when you wish to store an item separately in the database (following a relational database model), rather than inline.

In DLx, a lexeme refers broadly to any bundle of related senses and forms, whether the item is an individual word, morpheme, idiom, etc. \u2014 anything that constitues a semantic unit. Examples of lexemes in English might include *be*, *run up*, and *\u2011ing*. A lexeme will typically have multiple *senses* or meanings, and those are listed in the `senses` property. It is up to the linguist to decide when two meanings are related, and therefore belong to the same lexeme, or when they belong to different lexemes. A lexeme often also has multiple base forms, such as suppletive forms, irregular forms, or morphologically-conditioned forms. For example, the lexeme *be* has the base forms *be*, *am*, *is*, etc. These are listed in the `forms` field. The `forms` field should **not** be used to list all the regularly-inflected forms of a word. Individual base forms may have phonologically-conditioned allomorphs, and these are listed in the `allomorphs` field of the form. The lexeme and its forms and senses may also have variations, such as dialectal and idiolectal variants, rapid speech variants, register-based variants, variations in meaning, or even spelling variants. These are listed in the `variants` fields. By convention, one of the forms of a lexeme is typically chosen as a representative headword or *lemma*, and this is indicated by the `lemma` field. For example, the form *man* is typically used as the lemma\/headword for the lexeme that includes the forms *man* and *men*. Note that the DLx Lexeme does **not** represent a lexical entry in a dictionary. Dictionaries typically list each base form of a lexeme as a separate lexical entry.
