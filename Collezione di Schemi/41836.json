The underlying method is based on a hidden Markov random field model and an associated Expectation-Maximization algorithm. The whole process is fully automated and can also produce a bias field-corrected input image and a probabilistic and\/or partial volume tissue segmentation. It is robust and reliable, compared to most finite mixture model-based methods, which are sensitive to noise.","source":"https:\/\/github.com\/scitran-apps\/fsl-fast","label":"FSL: FMRIB Automated Segmentation Tool (FAST4, v5.0.9)","version":"0.1.1","url":"http:\/\/fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk\/fsl\/fslwiki\/FAST","maintainer":"Michael Perry <lmperry@stanford.edu>","license":"Apache-2.0","name":"fsl-fast","flywheel":"0","cite":"Zhang, Y. and Brady, M. and Smith, S.
