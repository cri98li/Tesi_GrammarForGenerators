Annotations are useful for indicating properties of a text which are anchored in time, or which cross the boundaries of linguistic objects like utterances and words. Examples uses might include: annotating a period of time when a speaker is whispering; annotating a stretch of the text as being a particular episode in the text; annotating the text for turns or prosodic units. Annotations should generally be used as a last resort. Whenever possible, data should be attached to linguistic objects, and represented as attributes of those linguistic entities. For example, it would be bad practice to use a timespan annotation to indicate the start and end times of a word. Instead, you should add the custom properties `startTime` and `endTime` to each Word object.
