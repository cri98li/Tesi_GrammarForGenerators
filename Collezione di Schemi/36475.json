(Only provided if the curve comes from rational control points.) A given algebraic curve is represented as a list of integer triples, each of which holds a coefficient, an x-exponent and a y-exponent. For example, for the curve with ``x(s) = 9 - 8 s`` and ``y(s) = (2 s - 1)^2``, we have ``16 y = (8 s - 4)^2 = (5 - x)^2`` which corresponds to ``f(x, y) = x^2 - 10 x - 16 y + 25``. This polynomial is represented by the four triples [25, 0, 0], [-16, 0, 1], [-10, 1, 0] and [1, 2, 0]. These will be ordered first by total degree, then in ascending order based on the x-degree. The coefficients will have a gcd of 1 and the ``lowest'' coefficient will be positive.","type":"array","items":{"maxItems":3,"description":"A coefficient, x-exponent, y-exponent triple.","type":"array","items":{"description":"One of coefficient, x-exponent, y-exponent.","type":"integer"}}},"___control_points":{"minItems":2,"maxItems":2,"description":"A list of x-y coordinates of the control points in the curve.","type":"array","items":{"minItems":1,"description":"An x-y coordinate pair for a single control point.","type":"array","items":{"$eref":{"oneOf":[{"type":"integer"},{"$ref":"#\/definitions\/fraction"},{"$ref":"#\/definitions\/ieee754"}],"$schema":"http:\/\/json-schema.org\/draft-04\/schema#","description":"A generic numerical value container: can be an integer, stringified fraction or stringified IEEE-754 value.","type":["integer","string"],"definitions":{"_88fraction":{"pattern":"^-?\\d+\/\\d+$","description":"A stringified fraction.
