It provides structured information about the 'status':'fail|error' reason(s) by specifying the structure of the 'data' key. Since the returned data for 'status':'success' depends on the API, the JSend spec is enough. The  returned data for 'status':'fail|error' should be in a format that is consumable by API consumers in a generic way. The JSend specification leaves this too open for interpretation. To provide a uniform way of consuming data for failures and errors, this schema defines an array of objects in the 'data' key. Each item in that array has at least the key 'message' with a human readable description of the failure. For an error, this will most likely be a single object specifying the error. In case it is possible to map it to an input field, an optional 'field' key can be used with a string representation of the map to the field. Even input in complex datastructures can be mapped this way. see https:\/\/labs.omniti.com\/labs\/jsend\/wiki","id":"https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/rolfvreijdenberger\/jsend-json-schema\/master\/jsend-extend-fail-error-json-schema.json","title":"jsend-extend-fail-error json schema","type":"object","definitions":{"_88success":{"description":"All went well, and (usually) some data was returned.","properties":{"___status":{"pattern":"^success$","description":"the status for a succesful handling","type":"string"},"___data":{"$eref":{"description":"a generic container for data returned for success, fail or error","type":["string","null","array","object","integer","boolean"]},"description":"Acts as the wrapper for any data returned by the API call.
