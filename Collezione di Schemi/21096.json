Each mode setting can have an argument, separated from the setting name by a colon. For most of these, the argument portion is optional; if the setting name appears without an argument, this works the same as \"setting:yes\". If a setting is included in the command.mode but also appears as a separate command property, the mode property will be overridden. Similarly, if a single setting appears more than once with different arguments, the last valid argument takes priority. The supported command.mode settings are: filter - accepts keyword arguments yes and no, quiet - accepts keyword arguments yes and no, replaceselection - accepts yes, no, and auto, savebefore - accepts yes, no, and prompt, subsystem - console, windows, shellexec, lua, director, winhelp, htmlhelp, immediate, groupundo - yes or no, Currently, all of these except groupundo are based on individual properties with similar names, and so are not described separately here. The groupundo setting works with subsystem 3 (lua \/ director), and indicates that SciTE should treat any changes made by the command as a single undo action. A command that uses the groupundo setting should not change which buffer is active in the editor.","type":["null","string"]},"___cmd":{"minLength":1,"description":"command to exec (switch selected subsystems).","type":["string"]},"___isFilter":{"default":"null","description":"The optional command.is.filter property states that the command modifies the current file so it may need to be read in after performing the command if load.on.activate is set.","type":["null","string"],"enum":[null,"0","1"]},"___input":{"default":"null","description":"On Windows, the optional command.input property specifies text that will be piped to the command.
