It provides structured information about the 'status':'fail' reason(s) by specifying the structure of the 'data' key. Since the returned data for 'status':'success' depends on the API, the JSend spec is enough. The data for 'status':'error' is in the key 'message'. Since an error is non-recoverable, the JSend spec suffices. The  returned data for 'status':'fail' should be in a format that is consumable by API consumers in a generic way. The JSend specification leaves this too open for interpretation. To provide a uniform way of consuming data for failures, this schema defines an array of objects in the 'data' key. Each item in that array has at least the key 'message' with a human readable description of the failure. In case it is possible to map it to an input field, an optional 'field' key can be used with a string representation of the map to the field. Even input in complex datastructures can be mapped this way. see https:\/\/labs.omniti.com\/labs\/jsend\/wiki","id":"https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/rolfvreijdenberger\/jsend-json-schema\/master\/jsend-extend-json-schema.json","title":"jsend-extend json schema","type":"object","definitions":{"_88success":{"description":"All went well, and (usually) some data was returned.","properties":{"___status":{"pattern":"^success$","description":"the status for a succesful handling","type":"string"},"___data":{"$eref":{"description":"a generic container for data returned for success, fail or error","type":["string","null","array","object","integer","boolean"]},"description":"Acts as the wrapper for any data returned by the API call.
